PROJECT TITLE: HEART DISEASE PREDICTION

DESCRIPTION : The purpose of the Heart Disease Prediction project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on clinical and demographic data. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and researchers by providing an additional tool for early diagnosis and prevention planning.

FEATURES:Key Highlights of the Heart Disease Prediction Project

1. Machine Learning-Based Predictions

2. Data-Driven Decision Support 
 
3. Focus on Preventive Healthcare
   
4. User-Friendly Implementation 
   
5. Real-World Impact

INSTALLATION:

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the CSV file
file_path = '/content/Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv'  # Adjust path if necessary
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print("First few rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())

# Display summary statistics
print("\nSummary statistics:")
print(df.describe())

# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing values in each column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Plotting pairwise relationships to understand correlations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.pairplot(df, diag_kind='kde')
plt.suptitle("Pairwise Relationships in the Dataset", y=1.02)
plt.show()

# Correlation heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap of Features")
plt.show()

Datasets:Heart Disease Prediction
Technologies Used: Mention libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
